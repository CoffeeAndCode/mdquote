# mdquote

A small, CLI tool to add Markdown blockquotes (`> `) to the start of every line.

## Installation

This package is not pushed to crates.io, but you can install it directly from
source by running:

```shell
cargo install --force mdquote --git https://github.com/CoffeeAndCode/mdquote
```

## Development

Run `bin/lint.sh` and `bin/test.sh` during development to simplify running
project linters and tests.

## Testing

A Github Actions workflow exists to run tests automatically when new code is
pushed to Github.
